<p><strong>Data (singular datum)</strong> are individual units of information.
A datum describes a single quality or quantity of some object or phenomenon.
In analytical processes, data are represented by variables.

Although the terms "data", "information" and "knowledge" are often used interchangeably,
each of these terms has a distinct meaning. In popular publications, data is sometimes said to
be transformed into information when it is viewed in context or in post-analysis.[2].
In academic treatments of the subject, however, data are simply units of information.
Data is employed in scientific research, businesses management
(e.g., sales data, revenue, profits, stock price), finance, governance
(e.g., crime rates, unemployment rates, literacy rates), and in virtually every other form of
human organizational activity (e.g., censuses of the number of homeless
people by non-profit sorganizations).</p>
